Human Drowsiness Detection
Overview
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using Python, leveraging computer vision techniques to monitor a person's eye state in real time. The system aims to alert users when drowsiness is detected, making it suitable for applications in driving safety, workplace monitoring, and health assessments.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Uses webcam feed to detect and analyze facial features.
Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation: Calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine if a person is drowsy.
Alert System: Sends visual or auditory alerts when drowsiness is detected.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Dlib
NumPy
imutils
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy imutils
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drowsiness-detection.git
cd drowsiness-detection
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python drowsiness_detection.py
Follow On-Screen Instructions: Allow camera access when prompted, and ensure good lighting conditions for best results.

Usage
The program will activate the webcam and begin monitoring your eye state.
If drowsiness is detected (when EAR falls below a specified threshold), an alert will be triggered.
Customization
You can adjust the EAR threshold and alert types in the config.py file.
Modify the alerting mechanism to suit your preferences (e.g., sound alerts, visual indicators).
